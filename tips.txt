What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?

THink about thiscode 
my_dict ={}
my_list = (1,2,3,4)
my_tuple = (1,2,3,4)
my my_dict[my_list]= true is wrong never do this as dict is immutalbe whereas the list is mutable
so just do my_dict[my_tuple]
also never cast the list into the tuple igt defeats the whole purpose of the dict

Overlapping Subproblems
is a characteristic of many problems that we know to solve
a lot of wasted computation

Memoization for fibonacci

def RecFiboM(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        if F[n] is undefined
            F[n] = RecFiboM(n - 1) + RecFiboM(n - 2)
        return F[n]

Given a log of length d, what is the best way to cut the 
long into pieces to maximize the total sales price?
