ks(i, w) ---> return value

like subset sum trying with the item or without to see if it will get the items we need

0       if i==len(p)
0       if W == 0
-inf    if W < 0

            with        v[i] + ks(i + 1, W - W[i])

return  max   

            without     0 + ks(i+1, W)

-pseudo polynomial problem this is 
-exponential time to solve this

sort the list with price/ weight ratio
add in the first one if it doesnt fit chop it off
