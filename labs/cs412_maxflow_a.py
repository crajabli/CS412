"""
Depth first search

Accepts a graph in an adjacency list (does not care about payload for edges)
Starts a traversal at s and stops when either there are no more vertices
to explore or it reaches vertex t.

Returns: list of predecesors/parents in the tree resulting from the DFS.
If vertex t is unreachable, it will not be in the returned dictionary
